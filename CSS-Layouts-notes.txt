Layouts: Floats, Flexbox, and CSS Grid

Layouts - the way text, images, and other content is placed and arranged on a webpage.
        - visual structure, into which we place our content.

Building a layout: arranging page elements into a visual structure, instead of simply having them placed one after another (normal flow)

** 2 types of LAYOUT **
1. PAGE layout
2. COMPONENT layout - the smaller components inside a page layout


** 3 WAYS OF BUIDING LAYOUTS W/ CSS **
