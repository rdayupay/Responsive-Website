Build Web Application

- Fake Email Application
- Side Navigation bar
- Top: Menu bar
- Scroll emails at left
- Middle Main part
- Side Bar
- Whole app is size of Viewport

<nav></nav> - element has bunch of navigation on the side which contain links and points to other places
<menu></menu> - for menu buttons in application
<main></main> - used to display most important element/part
<aside></aside> - for additional info

- the body element does not magically occupy the entire window space
- it only occupy the needed space
- set the height to 100vh to occupy the whole height of screen
{
  height: 100vh;
}

>> for BUTTONS
- always remove border {border: none;}
- always set {cursor: pointer;}

- to move another button to the right and let the margin automatically adjust depending on the screen size.
- when {justify-content: space-between;} doesnt work
{ 
  margin-left: auto;
}

- flexbox treats text as items  -

>> for SCROLL
- to not make the element grow larger than the content
- at the main container, set {overflow: scroll;}
- at the child element, set {flex-shrink: 0} -this will turnoff grow with content
section {
  overflow: scroll;
}
.email {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
- you don't have to do flex-shink if flexbox is not used.
- overflow: hidden; can also be used.
