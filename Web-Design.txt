== INGREDIENTS ==

+---------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #1: TYPOGRAPHY |
+---------------------------------+
- most important design ingredient and with most rules

Typography - making text beautiful and easy to read

SERIF vs SANS-SERIF
Serif
- has details at the end of line that looks like tails and called "serif" typeface
- creates a traditional/classic look and feel
- converys trustworthiness
- good for long text

Sans-serif
- doesn't have the decorative tails
- modern look and feel
- clean and simple
- easier to choose for beginner designer


RULES
- USE GOOD TYPEFACES

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
SANS-SERIF typefaces: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato
SERIF typefaces: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora

Toolbox: google fonts, font squirrel

2. It’s okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 
typefaces

3. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality

- USE GOOD FONT SIZES AND WEIGHTS

4. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a “type scale” tool or other 
pre-defined range

5. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for “normal” text

6. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

7. For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending 
on personality

8. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)

- CREATE A GOOD READING EXPERIENCE

9. Use less than 75 characters per line

10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go 
below 1.5

11. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come 
from experience)

12. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and 
increase letter-spacing

13. Usually, don’t justify text

14. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine


+-----------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #2: COLORS |
+-----------------------------+

-CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLOR

1. Make the main color match your website’s personality: colors convey 
meaning!
Red - power, passion, excitement
Orange - less agressive, happiness, cheerfulness, creativity
Yellow - joy, brightness, intelligence
Green - harmony, nature, growth, health
Blue - peace, trustworthiness, professionalism
Purple - wealth, wisdom, magic
Pink - romance, care, affection
Brown - nature, comfort, durability
Black - power, elegance, minimilasim, grief, sorrow

2. Use a good color tone! Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
Toolbox: OC- Open color, Tailwind CSS, FLAT UI Colors 2

- ESTABLISH A COLOR SYSTEM

3. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color 
and a grey color
Main color - primary color
Grey color - for text, darker shades

4. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent (secondary) 
colors (use a tool)
Accent - secondary color that blends well with main, use Toolbox
Toolbox: Palleton.com, coolors

5. For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” (tints and shades)
Tint - lighter version of color
Shades - darker version
Toolbox: Tint & Shade Generator

- WHEN AND HOW TO USE COLORS

6. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on 
the page
Buttons - uses main color to draw attention, logo uses it too

7. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or 
sections stand out

8. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations 

- COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY

9. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background (“lighter 
version”) for text

10. Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten if up it looks heavy 
and uninviting

11. Don’t make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and 
background colors
Toolbox: coolors
Contrast ratio: 13:1, 5.1:1


+-----------------------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #3: IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS |
+-----------------------------------------------+

- USE GOOD IMAGES

1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, 
illustrations, patterns

2. Use images to support your website’s message and story. So only use 
relevant images!

3. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images 
(not generic ones!)

Toolbox: Unsplash, Pexels, DrawKit, unDraw

- USE IMAGES WELL

4. Try to show real people to trigger user’s emotions

5. If necessary, crop images to fit your message

6. Experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns

- HANDLING TEXT ON IMAGES

7. Method #1: Darken or brighten image (completely or partially, using a 
gradient)

8. Method #2: Position text into neutral image area

9. Method #3: Put text in a box

- SOME TECHNICAL DETAILS

10. To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as 
their displayed size
*Scale factor: actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen
*On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)

600x600px will look 300x300px on high-res screen

11. Compress images for a lower file size and better performance
Toolbox: Squoosh (reduce file size by 96%)

12. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact 
same dimensions


+----------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #4: ICONS |
+----------------------------+

copy svg code and paste to HTML file

- USE GOOD ICONS

1. Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons packs
Toolbox: Phosphor icons, ionicons, ICONS8

2. Use only one icon pack. Don’t mix icons from different icon packs

3. Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don’t use bitmap image formats (.jpg and 
.png)!
*Vector-based - svg images and icon fonts.
- scale indefinitely!
*Bitmap - "regular images": JPG, PNG, GIF
- do not scale, become unsharp!

4. Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and filled/outlined 
depend on typography

- WHEN TO USE ICONS

5. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text

6. Use icons for product feature blocks

7. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or 
icon is 100% clear)

8. Use icons as bullet points

- USE ICONS WELL

9. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, 
use different color 

10. Don’t confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or 
action!

11. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, 
enclose them in a shape


!! ICON NOTES !!
Stroke: #color; - used for outline icons
Fill: #color; - used for solid icons


+------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #5: SHADOWS |
+------------------------------+

{box-shadow: 0 20px 30px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);}
{text-shadow: 0 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);}

2011->
Skeuomorphic design (w/ shadows) -> Flat design (minimal) -> Flat design 2.0 (brings back shadows and depth)

Shadows - creates depth (3D)

- USE SHADOWS WELL

1. You don’t have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the 
website personality

*Serious/Elegant (less shadows)
*Playful/Fun (more shadows)

2. Use shadows in small doses: don’t add shadows to every element!

3. Go light on shadows, don’t make them too dark!

- USE SHADOWS IN THE RIGHT SITUATION

4. Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw 
attention)

5. Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit 
more

6. Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the 
interface

7. Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)

Normal (no shadow)
Hover (Medium-sized shadow - pulling )
Click (smaller shadow - pushing)

8. Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
Shadows don't always have to be black

*Light source should be coming down from the top
