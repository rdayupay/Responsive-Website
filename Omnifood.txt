== RESPONSIVE DESIGN PRINCIPLES ==

-- Responsive Design
- technique to make a webpage adjust its layour and visual style to any possible screen size (window or viewport size)
- makes website usable on all devices
- not a separate technology, it's all just CSS!


-- Responsive Design INGREDIENTS

01 FLUID LAYOUTS
- allow webpage to adapt to current viewport width
- use % (or vh / vw) instead of px
- use max-width instead of width

02 RESPONSIVE UNITS
- use rem unit instead of px
- make it easy to scale the entire layout up or down automatically
- helpful trick: set 1rem to 10px for easy calculations

03 FLEXIBLE IMAGES
- by default, images don't scale automatically, fix that
- use % for image dimensions, together w/ max-width property

04 MEDIA QUERIES
- bring reponsive site to life!
- change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)
- useless alone, needs fluid layouts from the beginning. MQ only used at the end.


-- DESKTOP-FIRST vs MOBILE-FIRST Development

--Desktop-first
- start writing CSS for the desktop: large screen
- Use media queries to shrink design to smaller screens
- good practice to learn

--Mobile-first
- start writing CSS for moble device: small screen
- Use media queries to expand design to a large screen
- forces us to reduce websites and apps to the absolute essentials


-- rem and max-width
--MAX-WIDTH
- use max-width instead of width to occupy whole viewport and adjust to its size
{
  max-width: 1000px;
}

- if the container width is larger than the specified max-width, then the width of the element equals the value that was specified for max width.
- if the container width is less than the specified max-width, then the width of the element will be 100% of the container element widt

--REM
- rem is the root element's font-size
- html is the root document (parent element)
- if nothing's specified, 1 rem is equal the default element font-size (16px) since there's no defined font-size in html document.
- you can just change the rem size in html document, and that will affect the whole document..
{
  padding: 4rem;      //64px
  max-width: 50rem;   //800px
  font-size: 2rem;    //32px

  /* 1 rem = 16px by default */
}

- if you set 10px in html element, 1rem will now be equal to 10px instead of 16px.
- by using this, you can easily adjust all sizes for a bigger/smaller screen
html {
font-size: 10px;
}

.class {
  padding: 4rem;      //40px
  max-width: 50rem;   //500px
  font-size: 2rem;    //20px

  /* 1 rem = 10px */
}

- this can complicate things when user wants to change the font-size
- we can use % to address this problem.
- use 1rem = 10px for easy calculations
html {
  /* font-size: 10px; */

  /* 10px / 16px = 0.625 = 62.5%  */
  /* Percentage of user's browser font-size setting */

  font-size: 62.5%;
}
- 16 * 0.625 = 10px
- if the user change the font-size to 18px, then the default font-size will adjust to 11.25 (1rem) since 18*0.625 = 11.25 



== BUILDING THE HERO ==

- if you'll use section, there should be multiple sections in your page.

- add border inside the element box
use box-shadow and inset to contain the border inside
{
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 3px #fff;
}

- animate button in CSS
> put in the original state/class
{
  transition: all 0.3s;
}

{
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

- helper class to add gap between two buttons and reuse on other elements
> add this to the html element
.margin-right-sm {
  margin-right: 1.6rem !important;
}
