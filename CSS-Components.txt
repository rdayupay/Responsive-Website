== COMPONENTS AND LAYOUT PATTERNS ==

+--------------------------------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #10 - PART 1: ELEMENTS AND COMPONENTS |
+--------------------------------------------------------+

- From ELEMENTS to WEBPAGE

Step 1: Start with common ELEMENTS (paragraph, images, buttons).
Step 2: Assemble elements into common COMPONENTS (feature card, pricing table, tab component).
Step 3: Take all the component and use to build a LAYOUT using common layout PATTERNS.
Step 4: Take all the smaller layouts or one big layout and assemble a final WEBPAGE from them.

ELEMENTS -> COMPONENTS -(patterns)-> LAYOUTS -> WEBPAGE

1. Use common elements and components to convey your websiteâ€™s 
information

2. Combine components into layouts using common layout patterns
*can be repeating components a couple of times

3. Assemble different layout areas into a complete, final page

3. Z-pattern
4. F-Pattern
5. Single-column
6. Sidebar
7. Multi-column/magazine
8. Asymmetry/Experimental


== BUILDING AN ACCORDION ==
1. create the accordion as main container and add items as child elements
2. Choose 1 item and design with flexbox and grid
3. Create copies of the item
4. Temporarily add {display: none;} to the hidden box class to hide content like closing
5. Create a new class beside items (open), use this to show the hidden box for this particular item
6. Use {display: block;} to show the content as if it's open

CSS notes:
- rotate axis by 90 degrees
{
  flex-direction: column;
}


== BUILDING A CAROUSEL ==

CSS notes:
- adjust image size
{
  transform: scale(1.5);
}

>> Working with BUTTONS
- for buttons, always remove the default border {border: none;}
- remove from flex container by {position: absolute;} -> completely out of the flow of the page
.btn {
  border: none;
  width:
  height:
  position: absolute;
}

> Centering buttons
- first is set {top: 50%} to move the element by 50% of the parent container's height
- then use {transform: translate(0, -50%)} which moves again the element back by 50% of the actual element's height
- translate moves the element around, 0 means ignore the X (horizontal) value (x, y)
.btn--left {
  left: 0;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(0, -50%);
}

> Why not use flexbox to center?
- sometimes we don't want to use flex property for this due to gaps, this might not work
- we want this to be position absolute (outside the container)
- we want to use translate horizontally (technique)
- we want this to place outside the container, impossible to work with flexbox

> Centering buttons outside the container, center of border
.btn--left {
  left: 0;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

>> Working with Dots
- for empty space, put "$nbsp;" as a placeholder
.dots {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  bottom: 0;
  transform: translate(-50%, 32px);
}

>> Padding shorthand with 4 values
padding: top right bottom left;
{
  padding: 32px 48px 32px 86px;
}


== BUILDING A TABLE ==
Semantic table - not usually used, but nice to know.

<table></table>
<tr></tr> - table row
<td></td> - table data
<thead></thead> - first row
<tbody></tbody> - rows after the first
<th></th> - table head (makes it bold)

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Chair</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Width</th>
      <td>80 cm</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- if two borders are near each other, you can make it collapse to combine
{
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

- make the width of each table head equal 100/4=25
{
  width: 25%;
}


== PAGINATION ==
The "AND" selector

> This is a DESCENDANT SELECTOR
.page-link .page-link--current {
  color:
}

> This is an AND selector (no space), meaning the element has both classes
.page-link.page-link--current {
  color:
}

- to make the specificity (0,2,0) similar to other class applied at the beginning
- the one that is last (class) - the one that applies.
- when the changes at the bottom doesn't apply, it might have a specificity (0,1,0)

+------------------------------------------------+

C. SECTION COMPONENTS
1. Navigation

- sometimes there's a small uppercase heading

D. LAYOUT PATTERNS
- specific way of repeating components a couple of times
1. Row of boxes or cards

4. F-Pattern
- image->text
- text->image
5. Single-column
- simple websites or mobile phones, simple blogpost
6. Sidebar
- blogs, options, table of contents, for summary
7. Multi-column/magazine
