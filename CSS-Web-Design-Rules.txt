== INGREDIENTS ==

+---------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #1: TYPOGRAPHY |
+---------------------------------+
- most important design ingredient and with most rules

Typography - making text beautiful and easy to read

SERIF vs SANS-SERIF
Serif
- has details at the end of line that looks like tails and called "serif" typeface
- creates a traditional/classic look and feel
- converys trustworthiness
- good for long text

Sans-serif
- doesn't have the decorative tails
- modern look and feel
- clean and simple
- easier to choose for beginner designer


RULES
- USE GOOD TYPEFACES

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
SANS-SERIF typefaces: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato
SERIF typefaces: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora

Toolbox: google fonts, font squirrel

2. It’s okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 
typefaces

3. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality

- USE GOOD FONT SIZES AND WEIGHTS

4. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a “type scale” tool or other 
pre-defined range

5. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for “normal” text

6. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

7. For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending 
on personality

8. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)

- CREATE A GOOD READING EXPERIENCE

9. Use less than 75 characters per line

10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go 
below 1.5

11. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come 
from experience)

12. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and 
increase letter-spacing

13. Usually, don’t justify text

14. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine


+-----------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #2: COLORS |
+-----------------------------+

-CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLOR

1. Make the main color match your website’s personality: colors convey 
meaning!
Red - power, passion, excitement
Orange - less agressive, happiness, cheerfulness, creativity
Yellow - joy, brightness, intelligence
Green - harmony, nature, growth, health
Blue - peace, trustworthiness, professionalism
Purple - wealth, wisdom, magic
Pink - romance, care, affection
Brown - nature, comfort, durability
Black - power, elegance, minimilasim, grief, sorrow

2. Use a good color tone! Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
Toolbox: OC- Open color, Tailwind CSS, FLAT UI Colors 2

- ESTABLISH A COLOR SYSTEM

3. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color 
and a grey color
Main color - primary color
Grey color - for text, darker shades

4. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent (secondary) 
colors (use a tool)
Accent - secondary color that blends well with main, use Toolbox
Toolbox: Palleton.com, coolors

5. For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” (tints and shades)
Tint - lighter version of color
Shades - darker version
Toolbox: Tint & Shade Generator

- WHEN AND HOW TO USE COLORS

6. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on 
the page
Buttons - uses main color to draw attention, logo uses it too

7. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or 
sections stand out

8. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations 

- COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY

9. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background (“lighter 
version”) for text

10. Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten if up it looks heavy 
and uninviting

11. Don’t make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and 
background colors
Toolbox: coolors
Contrast ratio: 13:1, 5.1:1


+-----------------------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #3: IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS |
+-----------------------------------------------+

- USE GOOD IMAGES

1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, 
illustrations, patterns

2. Use images to support your website’s message and story. So only use 
relevant images!

3. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images 
(not generic ones!)

Toolbox: Unsplash, Pexels, DrawKit, unDraw

- USE IMAGES WELL

4. Try to show real people to trigger user’s emotions

5. If necessary, crop images to fit your message

6. Experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns

- HANDLING TEXT ON IMAGES

7. Method #1: Darken or brighten image (completely or partially, using a 
gradient)

8. Method #2: Position text into neutral image area

9. Method #3: Put text in a box

- SOME TECHNICAL DETAILS

10. To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as 
their displayed size
*Scale factor: actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen
*On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)

600x600px will look 300x300px on high-res screen

11. Compress images for a lower file size and better performance
Toolbox: Squoosh (reduce file size by 96%)

12. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact 
same dimensions


+----------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #4: ICONS |
+----------------------------+

copy svg code and paste to HTML file

- USE GOOD ICONS

1. Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons packs
Toolbox: Phosphor icons, ionicons, ICONS8

2. Use only one icon pack. Don’t mix icons from different icon packs

3. Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don’t use bitmap image formats (.jpg and 
.png)!
*Vector-based - svg images and icon fonts.
- scale indefinitely!
*Bitmap - "regular images": JPG, PNG, GIF
- do not scale, become unsharp!

4. Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and filled/outlined 
depend on typography

- WHEN TO USE ICONS

5. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text

6. Use icons for product feature blocks

7. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or 
icon is 100% clear)

8. Use icons as bullet points

- USE ICONS WELL

9. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, 
use different color 

10. Don’t confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or 
action!

11. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, 
enclose them in a shape


!! ICON NOTES !!
Stroke: #color; - used for outline icons
Fill: #color; - used for solid icons


+------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #5: SHADOWS |
+------------------------------+

{box-shadow: 0 20px 30px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);}
{text-shadow: 0 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);}

2011->
Skeuomorphic design (w/ shadows) -> Flat design (minimal) -> Flat design 2.0 (brings back shadows and depth)

Shadows - creates depth (3D)

- USE SHADOWS WELL

1. You don’t have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the 
website personality

*Serious/Elegant (less shadows)
*Playful/Fun (more shadows)

2. Use shadows in small doses: don’t add shadows to every element!

3. Go light on shadows, don’t make them too dark!

- USE SHADOWS IN THE RIGHT SITUATION

4. Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw 
attention)

5. Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit 
more

6. Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the 
interface

7. Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)

Normal (no shadow)
Hover (Medium-sized shadow - pulling )
Click (smaller shadow - pushing)

8. Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
Shadows don't always have to be black

*Light source should be coming down from the top


+------------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #6: BORDER-RADIUS |
+------------------------------------+

{border-radius: 12px; }

//remove radius on specific corners
.chair img {
  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;
}

*you can use {border-radius: 100px} to make it round

- USE BORDER-RADIUS WELL

1. Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to 
make it less serious

Serious/Elegant (less border-radius)
Playful/Fun (more border-radius)

2. Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius 
matches that roundness!

*Very round typeface, lots of border-radius in button, icons and image
*Boxy/squared typesface, but designers wanted to add some playfulness, so little border-radius

3. Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections 
and other elements


+---------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #7: WHITESPACE |
+---------------------------------+

*the right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, moderns and polished
*creates invisible relationship between the elements of a layout

- WHERE TO USE WHITESPACE

1. Use tons of whitespace between sections

2. Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements

3. Use whitespace between elements

4. Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines

- HOW MUCH WHITESPACE

5. The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the 
closer they should be!
*The Law of Proximity
*if the elements are not related to each other, they should be farther apart

6. Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then remove 
whitespace from there

7. Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need 
more whitespace

8. Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing


+---------------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #8: VISUAL HIERARCHY |
+---------------------------------------+

*establish which elements are the most important
*drawing attention to these most important elements
*defining a "path" for users to guide them throgh the page
*combination of position, size, colors,spacing, borders, and shadows

- VISUAL HIERARCHY FUNDAMENTALS

1. Position important elements closer to the top the page, where they get 
more attention

2. Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get 
more attention)

3. Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to 
emphasize elements

- VISUAL HIERARCHY TEXT ELEMENTS

4. For text elements, use font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to 
convey importance
*increase font size on important text
*increase font weight
*lighten color of less important text
*add whitespace
*add color on button/link

5. What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data 
points, icons
*de-emphasize less important text like labels or secondary/additional info

- VISUAL HIERARCHY BETWEEN COMPONENTS

6. Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or 
border (or multiple)

7. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B

8. What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, 
highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important 
rows/columns in tables, etc.


+-------------------------------------------+
| WEB DESIGN RULES #9: USER EXPERIENCE (UX) |
+-------------------------------------------+

Design is not just looks and feels like. Design is how it works. - steve jobs

*UI - visual presentation of a product.
"looks like and feels like"
>layout, personality, typography, colors, icons, etc..

*UX - overall experience the user has while interacting with the product.
"how it works"
>answer questions like: does the app feel logical and well thought out?
>does the navigation work intuitively?
>are users reaching their goals?

- UI AND UX DESIGN
*UI is graphical interface
*UI Design is what makes an interface beautiful

*UX is experience w/ interface
*UX Design is what makes an interface useful and functional

!!UX Design can not exist without UI Design!!

*UX DESIGN GUIDING PRINCIPLE: GOALS
>a website/application exists for a reason: a user has a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it

- UX RULES FOR USABILITY

1. Don’t design complicated layouts. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Use patterns 
that users know
*familiarity is much more important than being original

2. Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text 
descriptive
*usually buttons
*describe what the buttons will do (Reserve, Add to cart)

3. Use blue text and underlined text only for links!

4. Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 
milliseconds

5. In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form 
easier to scan

6. Offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc. 
[web apps]

7. Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality) [web 
apps]
*place the button where it will actually do the effect

- UX RULES FOR WEBSITE CONTENT

8. Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don’t be 
vague or fancy!
*describe the business actual purpose

9. Only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make the 
content 100% clear

10. Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and “smart-sounding” words

11. Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, 
etc.
